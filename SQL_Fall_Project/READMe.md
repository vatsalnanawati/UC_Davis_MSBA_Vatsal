# üí∞ Loan Classification: Predicting Loan Approvals & Defaults  

**Tools:** Python, MySQL, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, NLP, yFinance, SEC EDGAR API  

This project builds a **Loan Classification System** that predicts whether a loan will be **approved** or **defaulted** based on financial history, credit score, employment details, and other key factors. The system transforms raw financial datasets into structured tables, applies machine learning techniques, and performs sentiment analysis on AI-related financial disclosures.  

## üîç Key Highlights  
- **Database Creation & Table Normalization**: Converted a raw dataset into **six relational tables** (PERSON, EMPLOYMENT, CREDIT_HISTORY, LOAN, LOAN_FINANCIALS, HOME_OWNERSHIP) in **MySQL**.  
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Standardized categorical values, ensured data integrity, and handled missing values.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted key financial attributes impacting loan approvals and defaults.  
- **Loan Default Prediction Model**: Built classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict loan default risk.  
- **Financial Sentiment Analysis**: Used **NLP** on **SEC filings** mentioning AI to assess investor sentiment on loan-related market shifts.  
- **Historical Market Trend Comparison**: Retrieved stock market data using **yFinance** to analyze AI-driven financial impacts.  

## üöÄ Future Enhancements  
- Implement **deep learning models (Neural Networks)** to improve classification accuracy.  
- Expand sentiment analysis to include **news sources & social media data** for real-time loan risk assessment.  
- Develop a **loan risk dashboard** for real-time visualization of high-risk borrowers.  
- Integrate **alternative financial datasets** (hedge fund movements, institutional trades) for a broader risk assessment.  

üìä **Stay ahead in loan risk assessment with AI-powered insights!**
