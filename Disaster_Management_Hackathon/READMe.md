🌪️ Cascade Crisis AI: Predicting Disasters, Filtering Fakes, Guiding Response
Tools: Python, Scikit-Learn, GeoPandas, DBSCAN, Shapely, TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, Streamlit, Folium

This project builds a modular, real-time AI system to assist emergency response teams by predicting cascading disasters, verifying misinformation, and mapping infrastructure response zones. It integrates spatial intelligence, NLP, and classification techniques to guide responders in chaotic situations — faster, smarter, and with confidence.
