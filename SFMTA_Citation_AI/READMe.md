# 🚌 SFMTA Bus Citation AI - Smarter Transit Through Data

---

## 🎯 Goal: Decode Citation Patterns, Empower City Ops

This project leverages real-time and historical parking citation data from SFMTA to analyze spatial and temporal patterns of violations that affect public bus movement. The goal is to provide operational intelligence for smarter officer deployment and reduce transit inefficiencies caused by parking infractions.

**Mission:** Decode patterns in urban traffic enforcement to inform smarter transit operations.

## 🔍 What We Developed

- **📅 Time Feature Engineering**  
  → Extracted hour, weekday, weekend, and seasonal trends from citation timestamps.

- **📍 Hotspot Detection via Clustering**  
  → Applied `DBSCAN` on lat/lon data to discover high-density citation zones.

- **🗺️ Spatial Join by Neighborhood**  
  → Merged citation data with SF neighborhood shapefiles for area-wise violation mapping.

- **🧼 Cleaned & Encoded Categorical Features**  
  → One-hot encoded `violation_desc` and `analysis_neighborhood` to prep for ML.

## 🧩 Core Building Blocks

- **Socrata API Ingestion** — Retrieved 500,000+ citations using paginated API requests.
- **Datetime Parsing** — Engineered weekday, hour, and weekend indicators from `date_added`.
- **One-Hot Encoding** — Categorical features like violations and neighborhoods transformed for ML readiness.
- **DBSCAN Clustering** — Identified geographic hotspots using geospatial density.
- *(Planned)*: Supervised models (XGBoost, RF) for citation location prediction.
- *(Planned)*: Streamlit dashboard for interactive spatial/temporal exploration.

## 🚀 What’s Next: Expanding the Impact

- Train classifiers (e.g., XGBoost, RF) to predict future citation-prone areas  
- Integrate live bus delay data for correlation with citation clusters  
- Build an interactive **Streamlit dashboard** for real-time monitoring  
- Fuse external data: event schedules, road closures, and weather conditions
